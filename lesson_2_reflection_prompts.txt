What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git metadata file appears. This is necessary to tell Git that we will want

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

	The staging area allows one to gradually build a logical unit consisting of interconnected
	files which the user would like to commit.
